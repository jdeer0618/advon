Splunk, once again, steps up to the plate to offer free training to veterans through their SplunkWork+ program. Visit [SplunkWork+ | Veterans](https://veterans.splunk.com) for more details. Biggest hurdle to signing up is the time required to verify your military service through [TroopID](https://id.me).

I imagine taking the Splunk [Fundamentals 1](https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAPX9) training in concert with the free training offered to veterans would put you well on your way to a new career. The two won't get you to Splunk [Certified Architect](https://www.splunk.com/web_assets/pdfs/support/edu/v66/ArchitectCertPath66.pdf) but it's good start.
